However, this process is slow. Initially, the team had difficulty in identifying candidates with the right expertise. They have since managed to recruit a few suitable researchers, but the hiring process is taking time due to the quota restrictions imposed by MOM (Singapore) on S passes.\n\u00e2?\u00a2 As part of the implementation process, a test bed was agreed to be installed at National Cybersecurity Lab (NCL).The team had initially scheduled to complete the testing at NCL in two stages by 2019. The first stage will mainly focus on large scale tests done by BGU, and will include NTU\u00e2??s integrated parts in the second stage. However, due to the manpower issues mentioned above, the progress for the integration is delayed. Therefore, an extension of the project by another year will provide the team more time to perform the integration and testing. They have also plan to develop additional benchmarks for the final testing.\n\u00e2?\u00a2 Note that BGU is fully supporting the extension of the project to 4 years. BGU agrees on the new updated project plan and the updated deliverables\u00e2?? due date.\n\nIn view that the project\u00e2??s end date is on 31 Dec 2019 and grant extension should be made before the last 6 months of end term, we would greatly appreciate if you can advise at your earliest convenience so that we can prepare the team to submit the Project Revision Form to NRF.\n\nThank you and we look forward to your reply on this request.\n","query_id":293.0},{"clause_id":204,"raw_string":"Research Scholarship\nGeneral policy;; Not allowable unless specifically provided for in the grant and approved by the Grantor.

The previous project extension enabled many of the key deliverables to be met. However, the  senior researchers have progressively left to join the local industry and university since the mid of 2018.\n\u00e2?\u00a2 The team has been extensively recruiting researchers. However, this process is slow. Initially, the team had difficulty in identifying candidates with the right expertise. They have since managed to recruit a few suitable researchers, but the hiring process is taking time due to the quota restrictions imposed by MOM (Singapore) on S passes.\n\u00e2?\u00a2 As part of the implementation process, a test bed was agreed to be installed at National Cybersecurity Lab (NCL).The team had initially scheduled to complete the testing at NCL in two stages by 2019. The first stage will mainly focus on large scale tests done by BGU, and will include NTU\u00e2??s integrated parts in the second stage. However, due to the manpower issues mentioned above, the progress for the integration is delayed. Therefore, an extension of the project by another year will provide the team more time to perform the integration and testing. They have also plan to develop additional benchmarks for the final testing.\n\u00e2?\u00a2 Note that BGU is fully supporting the extension of the project to 4 years. BGU agrees on the new updated project plan and the updated deliverables\u00e2?? due date.\n\nIn view that the project\u00e2??s end date is on 31 Dec 2019 and grant extension should be made before the last 6 months of end term, we would greatly appreciate if you can advise at your earliest convenience so that we can prepare the team to submit the Project Revision Form to NRF.\n\nThank you and we look forward to your reply on this request.\n","query_id":293.0},{"clause_id":214,"raw_string":"Collaboration Guidelines\nEach Institution shall abide by the following guidelines when engaging in collaborations with any Collaborator pertaining to the Research.\n1.
