(2) there had been 2 RFs hired at one point during the project (before the last 6 months of the project); and
(3) during last 6 months of the project, a new RF is needed to replace one of the previous 2 RFs.

â?¢ Nonetheless, PIs should make â??reasonable effortsâ?? to hire Singaporeans/PRs to fill these positions where possible.

In that case, when PIs would like to transfer existing foreigner RFs to the NCR projects, are they still required to put up a brand new job posting BEFORE hiring these foreign candidate(s)?
o These foreigner RFs are already working in Singapore, on other projects (funded by other sources, which may or may not be from NRF).
o The main concern is that such manpower (RFs) with very specific skills and niche expertise are highly sought after, and hence a long transfer process could cause the PIs to lose the critical manpower needed to execute the NCR projects. 

We hope that NRF would be able to shed some light on the definition of â??reasonable effortsâ?? for such scenarios, where the PIs are trying their best to recruit the most suitable research expertise for their NCR projects, by drawing on their existing networks of skilled researchers in this growing field.
Such recruitment is critical in ensuring that they are able to stay on track for the project progress and KPI delivery.

On 22 July 2019, NRF has approved the addition of a new Research Assistant (EOM19) for one year to take over his research tasks. The new RA, Oh Ren Min has been hired on 9 Sep 2019 to take over part of the research tasks. This new RA (EOM19) will likely only be able to work on the project for one year and is able to take over the diversity characterization components that Dr Wainwright was doing. The phylogenetic components of the research remain to be taken over as he has not been able to find the suitable RF to join the project. He recently found another Singaporean RA, Chang Jia Jin Marc (CV attached), who will be able to complement the skill and experience of EOM19 (Oh Ren Min) to make up for Dr Wainwrightâ??s departure. Marc has more than 4 years of experience in phylogenetic and population biology and will be perfectly suited to the project.

PI will not be replacing the EOM02 Research Fellow, but would like to request to add another new Research Assistant (RA) position (EOM20) and to vire $70,000 from the RF (EOM02) to the new RA (EOM20) line item.

Could you please let me know if we could seek endorsement on the attached variation request form ?

I am writing with regard to the NCR grants awarded or to be awarded since end-2018, including the Renewal of the Singapore Cybersecurity Consortium, NSOE-TSS, SOCure, and also the upcoming NCL Phase 2.
The following requirement for hiring is stated in the Guidelines, which we understand is a flow down from the NR Fund Guide â?? 
3.6 The Host Institution, its hiring supervisor and Co-Investigators shall employ or otherwise engage Research Assistants/ Research Technicians or staff of equivalent qualifications who are Singapore citizens and/or Singapore Permanent Residents to be deployed in the work under the Research.
3.7 For the purposes of this Clause 3.6, the termâ?? Research Assistantsâ?? or â??Research Techniciansâ?? or staff of equivalent qualifications shall mean research technicians, or staff of equivalent qualifications who participate in the Research by performing mainly technical tasks as well as providing support functions distinct from the work carried out by the Investigators.
3.8 While Research Assistants/Research Technicians may provide intellectual input to the Research, they are not required to be directly involved in the management of the Research or for providing leadership in the conception and creation of new knowledge, products, processes, methods and systems under the Research.

May we enquire if the nationality requirement extends to non-research staff hired under the grant, such as admin staff, software engineers, business managers, etc.?

However, he has found a candidate (a current NTU research staff) who will be able to conduct the remaining task for the project. This candidate is a Singaporean who holds a bachelor degree holder and is able to fill up the position immediately. Prof Yoo informed that the team has developed a fabrication route and that the remaining task is more developmental and routine iterations which the candidate would be able to carry out with minimum guidance. The change in the manpower grade will not affect the project deliverables and does not require additional budget.

This purchase is needed because there is a slight change of research scope that requires the project team to build a simple prototype system to experimentally verify the proposed framework.  Instead of only performing simulation-based evaluation, experimental verification will be able to better demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed framework in this project. 
  Both Delta and NTU PIs are supportive to the purchase of the following consumables for building this prototype system and the justifications are highlighted in the following:
Ã?â?¢       Open Source 3D printer
o   This printer is needed to emulate an equipment that will be monitored with various sensors for data collection.  The project team is now at the stage of verifying the developed framework to analyse the collected data and provide analysis outcome/recommendations. Instead of directly applying the developed framework on available equipment in Delta-NTU Corporate Lab, the team would like to perform the verification on a simpler platform (in this case, an open source 3D printer), which offers more freedom and accessibility for sensor installation and data collection.
Ã?â?¢       Metawear sensors 
o   These are sensors are needed to collect the data from the emulated equipment
Ã?â?¢       Smart Phone
o   This smart phone is used to emulate a monitoring tool for tracking the data as well as display the analysis outcome from the developed framework
Ã?â?¢       Zigbee device
o   Wireless transmitting device to transfer the collected data to the server, which will be analysed by the developed framework
 
  At this stage, there is sufficient OOE budget in this project to support the abovementioned purchases. As these consumables are not originally listed in the project agreement, it is important for us to get your approval to support this purchase. 
   If there is any question or additional information to support this purchase, please do not hesitate to check with us.

We would like to seek NRFâ??s advise if the team is able to request for a 2nd project extension of 12 months without additional budget. 

Please refer to the following for the justifications of the project extension: 

â?¢ The project has started in a short delay due to recruitment difficulties and the prolonged process due to the quota restrictions imposed by MOM (Singapore) on S passes. The previous project extension enabled many of the key deliverables to be met. However, the  senior researchers have progressively left to join the local industry and university since the mid of 2018.
â?¢ The team has been extensively recruiting researchers. However, this process is slow. Initially, the team had difficulty in identifying candidates with the right expertise. They have since managed to recruit a few suitable researchers, but the hiring process is taking time due to the quota restrictions imposed by MOM (Singapore) on S passes.
â?¢ As part of the implementation process, a test bed was agreed to be installed at National Cybersecurity Lab (NCL).The team had initially scheduled to complete the testing at NCL in two stages by 2019. The first stage will mainly focus on large scale tests done by BGU, and will include NTUâ??s integrated parts in the second stage. However, due to the manpower issues mentioned above, the progress for the integration is delayed. Therefore, an extension of the project by another year will provide the team more time to perform the integration and testing. They have also plan to develop additional benchmarks for the final testing.
â?¢ Note that BGU is fully supporting the extension of the project to 4 years. BGU agrees on the new updated project plan and the updated deliverablesâ?? due date.

In view that the projectâ??s end date is on 31 Dec 2019 and grant extension should be made before the last 6 months of end term, we would greatly appreciate if you can advise at your earliest convenience so that we can prepare the team to submit the Project Revision Form to NRF.

Do they need to raise a virement request for this since the changes are the breakdown no of units and cost per unit with no change in overall total cost in each line item? 
2) Is there any restriction for the reimbursement of RSS(Subsidised vs non- subsidised tuition)?  The PhD students did not to take up Service Obligation (SO) hence they are paying non-subsidised tuition fees. Would the RSS be able to utilize for non-subsidised tuition fees?

We would like to seek NRFâ??s advise if the team is able to request for a 2nd project extension of 12 months without additional budget. 

Please refer to the following for the justifications of the project extension: 

â?¢ The project has started in a short delay due to recruitment difficulties and the prolonged process due to the quota restrictions imposed by MOM (Singapore) on S passes. The previous project extension enabled many of the key deliverables to be met. However, the  senior researchers have progressively left to join the local industry and university since the mid of 2018.
â?¢ The team has been extensively recruiting researchers. However, this process is slow. Initially, the team had difficulty in identifying candidates with the right expertise. They have since managed to recruit a few suitable researchers, but the hiring process is taking time due to the quota restrictions imposed by MOM (Singapore) on S passes.
â?¢ As part of the implementation process, a test bed was agreed to be installed at National Cybersecurity Lab (NCL).The team had initially scheduled to complete the testing at NCL in two stages by 2019. The first stage will mainly focus on large scale tests done by BGU, and will include NTUâ??s integrated parts in the second stage. However, due to the manpower issues mentioned above, the progress for the integration is delayed. Therefore, an extension of the project by another year will provide the team more time to perform the integration and testing. They have also plan to develop additional benchmarks for the final testing.
â?¢ Note that BGU is fully supporting the extension of the project to 4 years. BGU agrees on the new updated project plan and the updated deliverablesâ?? due date.

In view that the projectâ??s end date is on 31 Dec 2019 and grant extension should be made before the last 6 months of end term, we would greatly appreciate if you can advise at your earliest convenience so that we can prepare the team to submit the Project Revision Form to NRF.

214,"Collaboration Guidelines. Each Institution shall abide by the following guidelines when engaging in collaborations with any Collaborator pertaining to the Research. 1. The Institutions may engage in research collaborations involving any part or the whole of the Research with local or overseas Collaborators. Such collaborations, particularly with local Collaborators, are encouraged if the same enhance the Research and the results of the same. 2. The work in connection with the Research performed pursuant to the collaboration with the Collaborators should, to the extent possible, be carried out in Singapore. The Institutions are not permitted to contract out the whole or a substantial part of the Research to Collaborators. 3. Where possible, the Collaborators’ staff should be resident in Singapore, or be re- located to Singapore to undertake the research, although it is recognised that this may not always be possible in the case of Collaborators based overseas. In particular, it is understood that where the Research (and consequently, the Funding) relate to a joint grant call with an overseas funding agency or organisation, the Collaborators will be based overseas and the Collaborators’ scope of work under the Research will be undertaken overseas. 4. The Collaborators are not permitted to receive, directly or indirectly, any part of the Funding, whether in cash or in the form of Assets acquired using the Funding or otherwise. All Assets acquired using the Funding must be located in Singapore and maintained within the control of the Institutions. 5. Collaborators accessing and using Assets acquired using the Funding may only do so pursuant to the terms of the research collaboration agreement that is put in place to govern the collaboration and must do so on terms which are not more favourable than that allowed to any other Singapore based organisation (other than the Institutions). 6. The Institutions shall negotiate and agree upon ownership, intellectual property protection, commercialisation and revenue sharing rights in respect of the Intellectual Property arising from the Research undertaken in collaboration with the Collaborators in accordance with internationally accepted standards and in the best interests of the Institutions and Singapore. All such rights shall be negotiated, agreed upon and stipulated in a formal research collaboration agreement with each Collaborator, which shall be consistent with each Institution’s obligations under this Contract. 7. Minimally, the Institutions shall ensure that the Research IP shall be owned according to inventorship1 and that all revenues and other consideration derived from the use and commercial exploitation of the Research IP shall be shared between the Institutions andthe Collaborators in accordance with the overall contributions2 of the Institutions and the Collaborators. The Institutions shall not cede complete ownership of the Research IP to the Collaborator where the Collaborator or its staff has no inventive contributions without the prior written consent of Grantor- that is to say, in no event shall the Institutions or any one of them give up ownership where the Institutions’ staff, employees, students, agents or contractors are inventors or creators of the Research IP in question. 8. The Institutions shall keep Grantor informed of its negotiations with the Collaborators and the terms of the agreement and details of the same in a timely fashion. 9. The Institutions must at all times reserve the right to use the Research IP for their own research and development purposes and to make the same available to the local research community at least for non-commercial research and development purposes.","Can I find out on NRFÃ?â??s policy with regards to assets purchased using the given grant, please?
