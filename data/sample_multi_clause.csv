1,What is personal data?,1,"Personal data refers to data, whether true or not, about an individual who can be identified from that data; or from that data and other information to which the organisation has or is likely to have access"
1,What is personal data?,2,"This includes unique identifiers (e.g. NRIC number, passport number); photographs or video images of an individual (e.g. CCTV images); as well as any set of data (e.g. name, age, address, telephone number, occupation, etc), which when taken together would be able to identify the individual. For example, Jack Lim, 36 years old, civil servant, lives at Blk 123 Bishan St 23."
2,When did the PDPA come into force?,3,The PDPA was implemented in phases to allow time for organisations to adjust to the new law. The Do Not Call (DNC) Registry provisions came into force on 2 January 2014 and the personal data protection provisions came into force on 2 July 2014.
2,When did the PDPA come into force?,4,"The data protection provisions govern the collection, use and disclosure of personal data by organisations. In brief, the PDPA contains three main sets of data protection obligations:1. Obligations relating to notification, consent and purpose: Organisations must notify their purposes and obtain consent from individuals for the collection, use and disclosure of individuals’ personal data. 2. Obligations relating to compliance, accountability and access and correction: Organisations must make information available about their data protection policies, appoint a data protection officer, give individuals access to their personal data (upon request) and allow individuals to correct their personal data (also upon request).3. Obligations relating to safeguarding personal data: Organisation must: (i) comply with prescribed requirements when transferring personal data outside Singapore; (ii) use reasonable measures to protect personal data; (iii) make reasonable effort to ensure the accuracy of personal data; and (iv) cease to retain personal data when no longer required."
2,When did the PDPA come into force?,5,"The PDPA also provides for the establishment of a DNC Registry. The DNC Registry allows individuals to register their Singapore telephone numbers to opt out of receiving marketing phone calls, mobile text messages such as SMS or MMS, and faxes from organisations. You may refer to our website for more information on the data protection and DNC provisions."
3,What are the objectives of the PDPA?,6,"The PDPA aims to safeguard individuals’ personal data against misuse by regulating the proper management of personal data. Generally, individuals have the right to be informed of the purposes for which organisations are collecting, using or disclosing their personal data, giving them more control over how their personal data is used."
3,What are the objectives of the PDPA?,7,The PDPA also aims to enhance Singapore’s competitive advantages as a location for data hosting and management activities by strengthening Singapore’s reputation as a secure location for data and giving assurance to businesses looking for safeguards to protect sensitive data sets.
4,How does the PDPA benefit business?,8,The PDPA will strengthen Singapore's overall economic competitiveness and enhance Singapore's status as a trusted hub and choice location for global data management and processing services.
4,How does the PDPA benefit business?,9,"The law will provide greater clarity on the rules and liabilities for businesses hosting personal data in Singapore. This will complement Singapore's existing strengths, such as geographical location, reliability and advanced telecommunications infrastructure, to create a conducive environment for the fast-growing global data management and data processing industries, such as cloud computing, to thrive in Singapore."
4,How does the PDPA benefit business?,10,"The law will also put in place safeguards to protect data sets, which will help facilitate the smooth transfer of data to and from jurisdictions that have enacted data protection laws, many of which place obligations on organisations to ensure sufficient protection for transfer of data overseas. These safeguards serve as an attractive draw for cloud computing and business analytics activities to be located in Singapore. Compliance with the regime also sends a positive message and builds trust and credibility with consumers. Organisations will be able to assure their customers that their personal data will be sufficiently protected."
5,How will the PDPA impact business costs?,11,The provisions of the PDPA were formulated keeping in mind the need to keep compliance costs manageable for businesses. A transition period was provided to allow organisations sufficient time to phase in the necessary measures to comply with the data protection regime.
5,How will the PDPA impact business costs?,12,"There may be some costs associated with complying with the PDPA, especially for businesses that have not adopted any data protection practices. Those that already have adequate data protection measures in place should not incur high incremental costs to comply with the new law. The impact on Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) should also be minimal if they do not collect, process or hold on to large amounts of personal data."
5,How will the PDPA impact business costs?,13,"The costs should be viewed against the benefits of having such a law. As data protection legislation is increasingly seen as a basic feature in an economy's legal framework, the lack of a data protection regime potentially hinders the flow of information across borders, and disadvantages Singapore businesses in the global economy."
6,How is the PDPA different from the Spam Control Act?,14,"The Spam Control Act (SCA) sets out a framework to manage unsolicited commercial electronic messages sent in bulk through electronic mail, text and multimedia messaging, otherwise known as ""spam"". The SCA requires organisations to, among others, provide an unsubscribe facility within the spam message and include a header in the subject field of the message or where there is no subject field, as the first words in the message."
6,How is the PDPA different from the Spam Control Act?,15,"While the SCA manages the sending of spam messages, the PDPA sets out rules governing the proper collection, use and disclosure of personal data, which would include contact information of an individual. Under the PDPA, organisations are required to obtain consent for a stated purpose to collect, use or disclose the personal data of an individual, and safeguard such data, unless exceptions apply."
6,How is the PDPA different from the Spam Control Act?,16,"In addition, the provisions relating to the DNC Registry in the PDPA allow individuals to opt out of marketing messages (voice calls, SMS/MMS or fax) delivered to a Singapore telephone number. Organisations are generally prohibited from sending marketing messages to Singapore telephone numbers registered with the DNC Registry unless they have obtained clear and unambiguous consent in written or other accessible form from the user/subscriber to the sending of the message, or if the organisation can rely on the Personal Data Protection (Exemption from Section 43) Order 2013 or any other exclusions."
6,How is the PDPA different from the Spam Control Act?,17,"In relation to the sending of spam messages, the PDPA applies to the collection, use and disclosure of individuals' contact information for such purposes, while the SCA governs the manner in which the spam message may be sent. These frameworks will operate concurrently."
7,What is 'public available'?,18,"‘Publicly available’ in relation to personal data about an individual, means personal data that is generally available to the public. This includes personal data which can be observed by reasonably expected means at a location or an event – (a) at which the individual appears; and (b) that is open to the public."
7,What is 'public available'?,19,"An organisation need not obtain consent for the collection, use or disclosure of personal data that is publicly available but may still have to comply with other obligations under the PDPA."
8,"Can an organisation collect, use or disclose available personal data for any purposes?",20,"While an organisation may not obtain consent for the collection, use or disclosure of personal data that is publicly available, it may still have to comply with all other obligations under the PDPA."
8,"Can an organisation collect, use or disclose available personal data for any purposes?",21,"In particular, the PDPA provides that an organisation may collect, use or disclose personal data about an individual only for purposes that a reasonable person would consider appropriate in the circumstances. In this regard, the circumstances would need to be taken into account in determining whether the purpose is appropriate."
8,"Can an organisation collect, use or disclose available personal data for any purposes?",22,"Given that publicly available personal data is already made available to the public, the PDPC recognises that for the purposes of the PDPA, it would not be practical nor useful to unduly limit the purposes for which such data can be collected, used or disclosed, unless it is for clearly unreasonable purposes, for example, the purpose is in violation of a law or would be harmful to the individual concerned."
8,"Can an organisation collect, use or disclose available personal data for any purposes?",23,"In any case, organisations should note that their collection, use or disclosure of personal data from publicly available sources may be bound by terms and conditions imposed and enforceable by the data source."
